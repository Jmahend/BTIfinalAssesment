                Responsive design is a term used when web pages load on to various platforms
                that and can adapt. Different computers and platform that supports various layouts
                will differ for each, this is where the term responsive design comes in it allows for the 
                display to automatically adjust and fit to the current screen. In my research I discovered 
                that in order to have a responsive design the developer will make only one source code but modify the 
                style sheets for each unique platform. This elimantes recoding the same work and can save the developer time
                by not recreating various sheets. 
                <br><br>
                My design relates to web technologies because the layout that I have created is a modular layout which
                in theory can be used across different platorms, which relates back to the responsive design of supporting 
                different platforms. This also relates to web technologies because I have proportion based grids and flexible 
                images which can be carried over across different platforms. 
                <br><br>
                Through my research I have concluded that creating a web apps for different device is difficult because of the
                restriction on other platforms. For example the average window width on a phone is around 320 to 639, tablet is
                around 640(portrait), and 960(landscape). Through these different feild sizes it is diffucly to adapt all infromation
                from web apps to fit these certain requirments, as well as keeping in trend with the newest technologies.

                My learning experince in this course was excellent. I felt the stratedgy of teaching without a formal class gives the 
                freedom of the student to work at their own pace. In my experience it had a positive outcome on my marks because in this 
                program we learn about 4 different languages or system a semester and to be able to keep up with all of them is hard because of 
                different teaching styles. The way the videos are labelled and presented taught the main idea of what was presented and helped 
                to create a better learning experince. The marking schemes were also very fair, I dont think marks were taken off for no reason
                and for when there was marks taken off it was a reasonable deduction. Lastly I enjoyed the freedom of code that we were given. We 
                could experiment with everything we were taught throughout each assignment and this allowed us to show the conecepts of what we learned
                throughout the course.
